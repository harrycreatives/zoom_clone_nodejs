### Initialise the project
* To initialise the project run the command `npm init`
* I didnt gave any inputs to the options while initialising the node.js project.
* After initialisation, `package.json` file will be created.

### Install dependencies
* `npm install express` This is how we are going to build our api
* Another way to install express `npm i express` (Here i is short form of install)
* After the installation, express is added to dependencies in `package.json`
